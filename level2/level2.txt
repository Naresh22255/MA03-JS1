Level 2 Process
1.	In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is. 
JavaScript Code Style is Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions. It is a set of standards that how a code should be written and organised. In huge projects there will be plenty of developers working on the same codes. Using Style guide, it will be easy for the other developers to  understand the code quickly and easily. 

2.	What is a Regular Expression?
A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters. The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text.

3.	What does the .random() method do?
Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive)

4.	What does the .sort() method do?
The sort() method sorts the items of an array. The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric, and either ascending (up) or descending (down). By default, the sort() method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.

5.	What does the .reverse() method do?
The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array.

6.	List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
var Car = “BMW”;
Creating a variable name with Capital letter is a bad practice. 
Not using these expressions in a proper place (=)/(==)/(===) is a a bad JavaScript code.  





7.	What data types can a JSON object contain? 
JSON can contain these data types. 
    object
    array
    string
    number
    "true"
    "false"
    "null"

8.	What is minifying JavaScript Code?
Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.

9.	What is a global variable?
A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name.
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
